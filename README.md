# Working Memory Training
Project ID: WMT

Expected experimentation period:
Start date: 31/10/2019
End date: 10/03/2020

Experimental location:
Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, Montreal, QC

Task Description:
The auditory working memory task administered during the screening test and throughout the 7 experimental sessions involved the mental manipulation of the order of three pure tones and is depicted in Figure 1A. In each 15-s trial, a sequence of three tones was presented, followed by a silent retention period of 3800 ms. A visual cue then appeared on the screen, consisting of the numbers 1, 2, and 3 in variable order. The order of these numbers corresponded to the order of tones in a reordered target sequence. For example, the visual cue “312” instructed participants to reorder the sequence of the original tones (say, A-B-C) such that the third tone now came first, that is, C-A- B. Finally, after 5 s participants were presented with a second tone sequence and indicated by left or right click on a mouse whether it was a ‘match’ or ‘mismatch’ to the target sequence, that is, the correct manipulation of the encoded sequence. At the end of each trial, visual feedback indicated whether the response was correct.

Participant categories:
We retained 18 neurologically healthy young adults (8 women; mean age of 22 years, ranging from 18 to 29 years) to participate in our study after screening (see below). All participants were right-handed and reported normal hearing and no history of neurological disease. Nine participants had some musical training, with an average duration of 2.5 years and no participant having more than 4 years of training.
